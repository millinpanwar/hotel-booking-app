# Mock App

Goal of the mock is to create an early alpha for the app. That way we can
implement the frontend and see where this is going.

I will create a simple flask app with the following routes:

* `/`
* `/country/`
* `/country/city`
* `/hotel-name`

The data for countries and cities can come from [GeoNames](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/).
The data for a handful of hotels can come from a json or yaml file.
